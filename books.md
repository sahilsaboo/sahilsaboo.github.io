		<h3>Project Hail Mary</h3>
		<p><i> Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission—and if he fails, humanity and Earth itself will perish. Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it. All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he’s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it’s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery—and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species. And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he’s got to do it all alone. </i></p>

		<h3>Maybe In Another Life (DNF)</h3>
		<p><i> Following a breakup and a return to her hometown of Los Angeles, Hannah reconnects with her high school boyfriend, Ethan. At the end of the night, she must choose between going home with Ethan or with her best friend, Gabby. The novel explores the consequences of each decision, with alternating chapters showing radically different outcomes for Hannah's life, love, and career. The story questions fate, free will, and the concept of a soulmate. </i></p>
		<p> One of my book clubs picked this book up and although I'm not usually a fan of rom-coms in written form, I tried to like it since I do love exploring the idea of butterfly effects and parallel dimensions. That being said the first half of the book literally read like a 14 year old's diary and no matter how hard I tried I simply could not power through. This joins a rare crowd as only the <i>third</i> DNF on my Goodreads.</p>

		<h3>The Night Circus</h3>
		<p> <i>The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night.<br>
		But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. </i> </p>
		<p>The night circus taught me that I’m here for the plot more than I am for the vibes. <br>
		This book is fully vibes/atmosphere based, for better or worse. The writing is immaculate.</p>
